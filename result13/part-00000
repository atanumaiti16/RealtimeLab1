A group of businessmen in suits lingered nearby
A moment later, Stone finally settled in by a window, comfortably beyond earshot of the other patrons.
Activist journalists wanted access to him
After early successes like “Platoon” and “Wall Street,” his more recent films didn’t receive the attention he hoped
After enduring the United States’ endless lectures about human rights, the Kremlin could suddenly welcome a man who exposed large-scale American hypocrisy.
An experienced lawyer, Kucherena was appointed by Putin to the Public Council, overseeing the Federal Security Service (F.S.B.)
And there are some things you're sure about but wish you weren't 
As Snowden became a celebrity, a cause and a historical event, the web of people who wanted to take part in it widened
As real-life narratives go, Snowden’s is a compelling one
As the economy collapsed in 2008, the financing evaporated
At the time, Stone and Borman were barely speaking after a falling-­out during the making of “Savages,” a beachy Blake Lively thriller
Borman asked the lawyer to send the book and two first-class tickets to Moscow
Both arrived the next day
But first Stone and Borman had to make sure Kucherena was for real
But politically speaking, he could be useful
But this was Snowden, who single-­handedly exposed the colossal scale on which the United States had been surveilling its citizens
By the summer of 2013, he had downloaded thousands of documents, taken off for Hong Kong and asked the journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras to meet him there.
Civil-­liberties lawyers wanted to represent him
Depending on your feelings about national security, the N.S.A.’s actions were either necessary or unconstitutional
Despite promising an “inside” look, neither writer had ever met Snowden.
Donald Trump called for his execution.

Ever since Stone decided to make a biopic about Edward Snowden, the American whistle-­blower currently holed up in Moscow somewhere, the director — who became a Buddhist while making “Heaven & Earth” and sampled a buffet of psychedelic drugs for “The Doors” — had gone all method again
For Russia, Snowden was like a bird that flew in through an open window — or, as Putin joked, an unwanted Christmas present
He enlisted in the Army, went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency and became a technology specialist for the N.S.A
He eyed an older couple slurping soup and kept moving
He had embarked on a trip to Ecuador, but the United States revoked his passport midflight, leaving him stranded in Moscow
He ordered a decaf coffee and began to lay out the events that led him and Borman to be hanging out in Russian hotels, on the lookout for potential spies
He spent two decades trying to get a biopic about the Rev
He walked past the marble staircase and the grand piano to a table in the back
His producer, Moritz Borman, led the way to another corner
His transformation from a shy and pale 20-­something — full of the sort of idealism those years can afford — to political dissident made him a hero figure to anti-­establishment liberals who are in the business of storytelling
If it panned out, it could be Stone’s millennial follow-­up to “Born on the Fourth of July,” the Ron Kovic biopic that won him an Oscar in 1990.
In 2012, he campaigned for Vladimir V
In 2014, Greenwald published “No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the N.S.A
In January 2014, months before the book was published, Kucherena called Borman to see if Stone might like to make it into a Hollywood movie.
In case they still had doubts, Kucherena’s office gave Borman a number to call
In the course of his career, Kucherena has represented Russian oligarchs, film directors, a few pop singers and a state minister
It took Kucherena a month to negotiate Snowden’s stay and three months to write “Time of the Octopus.”
It wasn’t just about Borman
Kucherena entered the picture as Snowden’s lifeline, or at least as someone who could help him navigate Russia’s asylum laws
Martin Luther King Jr
Merrill Lynch put up cash, Bruce Willis was set to star and Stone built an entire village in Thailand
Most had his best interests in mind, but his story also happened to advance agendas that had long needed an appealing spokesperson
Not again,’ ” Stone continued
Not only had the N.S.A
On the other end was an employee of the Russian consulate in San Francisco, who turned out to be a big fan of “The Life of David Gale,” a film Borman produced
On “Snowden,” he and Borman became so preoccupied with American government surveillance that they had their Los Angeles offices swept for bugs more than once.
Plus, the director needed a hit
Principal photography wrapped a month earlier, and now Stone had come to Moscow to film Snowden for the movie’s grand finale
Publishers rushed out books, including “The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World’s Most Wanted Man,” by Luke Harding of The Guardian, and “The Snowden Operation: Inside the West’s Greatest Intelligence Disaster,” by Edward Lucas of The Economist

Raised in a family of federal employees, Snowden grew up near Fort Meade, Md

Such security precautions had become routine

That fall, Poitras released “Citizenfour,” a tense and spooky documentary about a modest and intelligent young man who hid under a blanket when typing on his laptop
The Apple co-­founder Steve Wozniak called Snowden a hero
The Guardian published the leaks, and Greenwald eventually revealed the identity of his source in a video shot by Poitras

The Snowden story had all the ingredients of an epic Stone picture: politics, government conspiracy and, at the center of it all, an American patriot who had lost faith
The call had come from Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden’s Russian lawyer
The director hadn’t been sleeping well
The initial revelations were sensational
Then Kucherena wrote a novel about his new client
Then there was the My Lai massacre film

“And I know you from working on, what, three films?” Stone said at the bar.
“Five,” Borman said.

“How’s this?” Borman asked.
“I think we should move,” he said
“Last January, Moritz calls me,” Stone said
“We’ve had our fights,” Stone said
“When that happened,” Borman said, “I thought, O.K., I guess Kucherena can pull the strings.”
“You get these scars, and they don’t go away,” Stone said.
“You know, he’s German; I’m American.” He didn’t elaborate.
